"It is the year 2999++. In a distant Utopia, humans have finally reached the peak of their quantam creations. From the
ashes of their previous nuclear wars, they have created anti-matter exquisite rail guns, capable of packing punches 
almost as strong as Chuck Norris. Inspite of their weird 'text-book' designs, they are capable of launching projectiles
of specific anti-matter, that only harms their opponents, and not thmeselves. In such an war-breaking environment,
a team of three persons decides to wage firendly battles among nations to prove their supiriority and to claim the 
thrones of the seven and a half kingdoms. Do you have the courage to battle it out???


						----->>GAMEPLAY<<-----

At the beginning of each game, the WARDROBE ( World Artillery Railgun Development & Research Official Board Ex) will select
a specific distance between the Railguns of the two opposing teams. As 1 comes before 2, player 1 will get the first shot.
Unfair in low HP, right? Well, WARDROBE does not care. And they have given you the permission to select HP before each match.
Each turn, players will face the difficulty of winds, generated by high quality fans and anti-matter (Nuclear is old school)
projectiles of different weights. By controling the winds, weight, angle of the cannon and the power, only the best of the 
bests (Luckeist of luckiests in low HP) will survive. So, are you ready to play (in not low HP)?

Main Menu : Press 'UP' and 'DOWN' arrow keys to navigate, 'ENTER' to select. I do not know how you have made to the HELP menu.

In-Game : Use 'UP' and 'DOWN' arrow keys to cycle through angles and press 'ENTER' to confirm.
Input power using the keyboard. Do not try to enter more or less power than capacity. You just have to input again.
If you wish to cheat against your opponent, it is completely fine. Just do not get caught.
The closer the projectile lands to target, the more damage it will deal, ranging from critical,good shots to simple scratch.

N.B. > Using 0 power will make the projectile land on yourself, But you do not take damage. As developers, we can do that...

GOOD LUCK...
